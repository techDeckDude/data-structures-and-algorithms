## Binary Tree Types

### Full Binary tree 
- every node in the tree has 0 or 2 children

### Perfect binary tree 
- all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or level

### Complete binary tree 
- every level except possibly the last is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible
